				<h3 id="block_1">What is quantum computing?</h3>
				<p>Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to
					solve
					problems too complex for classical computers. </p>
				<p>Today, IBM Quantum makes real quantum hardware -- a tool scientists only began to imagine three
					decades
					ago -- available to thousands of developers. Our engineers deliver ever-more-powerful
					superconducting
					quantum processors at regular intervals, building toward the quantum computing speed and capacity
					necessary to change the world.
				</p>
				<p>These machines are very different from the classical computers that have been around for more than
					half a
					century. Here's a primer on this transformative technology.

				<h3 id="block_2">Why do we need quantum computers?</h3>
				<span>For some problems, supercomputers arent that super.</span><br>
				<span>When scientists and engineers encounter difficult problems, they turn to supercomputers.<br> These
					are
					very large classical computers, often with thousands of classical CPU and GPU cores.<br> However,
					even
					supercomputers struggle to solve certain kinds of problems.</span><br>
				<span>If a supercomputer gets stumped, that's probably because the big classical machine was asked to
					solve
					a problem with a high degree of complexity.<br> When classical computers fail, it's often due to
					complexity.</span><br>
				<span>Complex problems are problems with lots of variables interacting in complicated ways.<br> Modeling
					the
					behavior of individual atoms in a molecule is a complex problem, because of all the different
					electrons interacting with one another.<br> Sorting out the ideal routes for a few hundred tankers
					in a
					global shipping network is complex too.</span><br>
				<span><mark>Some complex problems are less obvious:</mark><br> A supercomputer would struggle to find
					the ideal
					seating
					arrangement of even 10 guests at a dinner party if they don't all want to sit next to one another,
					or to find the prime factors of a big number.</span>

				<h3 id="block_3">Why quantum computers are faster</h3>
				<mark>Let's look at example that shows how quantum computers can succeed where classical computers fail:
				</mark>
				<p>A supercomputer might be great at difficult tasks like sorting through a big database of protein
					sequences. But it will struggle to see the subtle patterns in that data that determine how those
					proteins behave.</p>
				<p>Proteins are long strings of amino acids that become useful biological machines when they fold into
					complex shapes. Figuring out how proteins will fold is a problem with important implications for
					biology and medicine.</p>
				<p>A classical supercomputer might try to fold a protein with brute force, leveraging its many
					processors to check every possible way of bending the chemical chain before arriving at an answer.
					But as the protein sequences get longer and more complex, the supercomputer stalls. A chain of 100
					amino acids could theoretically fold in any one of many trillions of ways. No computer has the
					working memory to handle all the possible combinations of individual folds.</p>
				<p>Quantum algorithms take a new approach to these sorts of complex problems -- creating
					multidimensional spaces where the patterns linking individual data points emerge. In the case of a
					protein folding problem, that pattern might be the combination of folds requiring the least energy
					to produce. That combination of folds is the solution to the problem.</p>
				<p>Classical computers can not create these computational spaces, so they can not find these patterns.
					In the case of proteins, there are already early quantum algorithms that can find folding patterns
					in entirely new, more efficient ways, without the laborious checking procedures of classical
					computers. As quantum hardware scales and these algorithms advance, they could tackle protein
					folding problems too complex for any supercomputer.</p>

				<h3 id="block_4">How do quantum computers work?</h3>
				<span>Quantum computers are elegant machines, smaller and requiring less energy than supercomputers. An
					IBM
					Quantum processor is a wafer not much bigger than the one found in a laptop. And a quantum hardware
					system is about the size of a car, made up mostly of cooling systems to keep the superconducting
					processor at its ultra-cold operational temperature.</span>
				<span>A classical processor uses bits to perform its operations. A quantum computer uses qubits
					(CUE-bits)
					to run multidimensional quantum algorithms.</span>
				<h4>Superfluids</h4>
				<span>Your desktop computer likely uses a fan to get cold enough to work. Our quantum processors need to
					be
					very cold about a hundredth of a degree above absolute zero. To achieve this, we use super-cooled
					superfluids to create superconductors.</span>
				<h4>Superconductors</h4>
				<span>At those ultra-low temperatures certain materials in our processors exhibit another important
					quantum
					mechanical effect: electrons move through them without resistance. This makes them
					"superconductors." When electrons pass through superconductors they match up, forming "Cooper
					pairs." These pairs can carry a charge across barriers, or insulators, through a process known as
					quantum tunneling. Two superconductors placed on either side of an insulator form a Josephson
					junction.</span>
				<h4>Control</h4>
				<span>Our quantum computers use Josephson junctions as superconducting qubits. By firing microwave
					photons
					at these qubits, we can control their behavior and get them to hold, change, and read out individual
					units of quantum information.</span>
				<h4>Superposition</h4>
				<span>A qubit itself isn't very useful. But it can perform an important trick: placing the quantum
					information it holds into a state of superposition, which represents a combination of all possible
					configurations of the qubit. Groups of qubits in superposition can create complex, multidimensional
					computational spaces. Complex problems can be represented in new ways in these spaces.</span>
				<h4>Entanglement</h4>
				<span>Entanglement is a quantum mechanical effect that correlates the behavior of two separate things.
					When
					two qubits are entangled, changes to one qubit directly impact the other. Quantum algorithms
					leverage those relationships to find solutions to complex problems.</span>

				<h3 id="block_5">Quantum computing hype vs. reality</h3>
				<p>IBM Quantum is your partner to cut through the hype surrounding quantum computing, and to position
					your institution to leverage this emerging technology for competitive advantage. Here's what
					business leaders need to understand about quantum computing today.</p>
				<p>Quantum computers are poised to transform the way you work in research. Classical computers get
					bogged down trying to model natural systems, including chemical reactions and folding proteins.
					Quantum computers offer a new set of tools to understand the universe.</p>
				<p>Programming for quantum computers doesn't require extensive retraining or new coding languages. But
					it will give you access to an entirely new computing paradigm all the same. Here are the basics you
					need to know to get started with quantum development today. </p>
